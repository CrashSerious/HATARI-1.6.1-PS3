Hatari 1.6.1 modified source code for PS3

This is just the modified files from Hatari-1.6.1 ( http://hatari.tuxfamily.org/ ) to compil and run on the sony PS3 with the PSL1GHTV2 SDK.
you can download the hatari base source code here : http://download.tuxfamily.org/hatari/1.6.1/ .

As you can see , this is the minimal hack to the original source code to compil and run under the PS3 with PSL1GHTV2 sdk.
